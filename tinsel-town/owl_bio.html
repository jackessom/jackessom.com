<p>"Life's like a play; it's not the length but the excellence of the acting that matters" Roman Philosopher</p>

<p>Today I go as "Gabriowl", tomorrow? Tomorrow I may be Ophelia, Cleopatra, Woman 1, Chorus member, Tree..... Few know my real name, only to those in my theatre group can I reveal my true identity, for with them I must share my very soul in order to fully embody my work. To all others I am The Role, The Partâ€¦The Thespian. Since the tender age of two acting has been my life, preferably the method acting wisdoms of Stanislavski. My first role was a mole in Wind and the Willows in prep school and I spent so long down in the woods, burrowing, my parents became quite concerned. Nobody truly understands what it is to be a true actor. My work is unique. Organic. </p>

<p>"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a trade. With it, it becomes creation." Bette Davis</p>
