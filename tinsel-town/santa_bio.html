<p>
For Hire.</p>

<p>'Energetic' Santa for hire: Available for Christmas parties, Grottos, Bachelor Parties and Birthdays. Specialises in Funerals. </p>

<p>With over 60 years experience in his profession, he has given his life to playing Santa, so get him while he is still fresh. </p>

<p>With plenty of patience he can take even the biggest child on his lap. He feels no pain. </p>

<p>He needs no breaks and requires no food or drink. His dedication is unparalleled by any contemporaries. All that is required for you to provide is air freshener as his intensity in his role, and confined space, can mean that after a while he will begin to smell. </p>

<p>Also required is wheelchair access as his movement is limited and he requires the help of his special elves that aid him in his spreading of Christmas cheer. (They also ensure he doesn't spread anything else.)</p>

<p>So hurry now to book this dead ringer for the real Santa. You'll miss him when he's really gone. </p>
