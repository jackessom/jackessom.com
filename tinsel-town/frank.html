<div class="staffheader" style="font-size:24px;">Frank the Elf</div>

<p>From chasing away unwanted visitors to supplying our food stall with the best quality food, Frank is the park's head elf. He has a little problem with cows, his mother was killed by one, and hasn't yet really found his true self, hence the ever changing accent. He's a firm believer in Christmas and is a decent guy, unless you're a cow. </p>
