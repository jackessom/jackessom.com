<p>I'm not here because I want to be. This isn't my first choice of venue to protect. I do this for my uncle. It's nice to work with my family. I mean, I love them, they are my family. But I think I'll go postal if I have to celebrate Christmas much more. And the bloody hat is so itchy I have a permanent red rash across my forehead.  This is not my first choice. I'm a professional.  

Security and protection runs in my blood. My family has a long history in service to the protection of powerful and famous persons. My father was my inspiration, protecting the Beatles, and after the split he became John Lennon's head security guard.
