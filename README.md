# react-boilerplate
A custom built react boilerplate that i'll keep up to date with my preferences allowing me to quickly start projects.

I'm using a similar style of setup as create-react-app as in npm scripts are calling node scripts that pull in the Webpack configs instead of just running the configs in the default way.

## Stack currently includes:
- React
- Webpack
- Webpack Dev Server
- Babel
- ESLint (using Airbnb rules)
- Stylelint (using [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard))
- Jest

### next steps:
- commenting start/build/config scripts a bit more
- improve production build scripts
- create a test node script
